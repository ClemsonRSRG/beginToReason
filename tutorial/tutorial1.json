  "learningObjective": "In analyzing code, sometimes we need to relate variable values to values remembered at an earlier point in program execution. The <b>Remember</b> construct is useful for this.  When using <b>Remember</b>, the value of 'I' at the remembered point is '#I'.",

  "problemStatement": "Analyze the following code and state the relationship between the value of 'I' at the end and its remembered value.  Replace /* conditional */ with one of =, <, >, <=, >=.  DO NOT EDIT THE CODE IN ANY OTHER WAY.",
